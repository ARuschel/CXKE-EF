# XKE / CAPS / CARS / XKE-EF

This is a heavily modified fork of [OpenKE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE) and contains implementations of XKE, CAPS, CARS and XKE-EF.

## Note

This code is still under development and backward compatibility for past commits is not to be expected. A few hardcoded paths are still present in some files, but they can easily be changed to adapt the framework to your environment.
